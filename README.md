# MR carbon zero
A resource for MRI institutes / radiologic institutes towards realization of carbon neutral MRI.

## Current general energy demand of MRI
The energy demand of “a single MRI machine in clinical use […] corresponds to 25.8 four-person households” [[1]](#Literature) The “daily energy consumption for a clinical MRIs  scanner in operation for 13 hours was estimated to be 363 kWh with 1.5 T units and 530 kWh with 3.0 T units”1. Yearly (300 days) 108 MWh with 1.5 T  and 159 MWh with 3 T. 

### Helium demand / zero boil off

### Dynamic energy demand 

## Options to save energy

### simple

### advanced and to be tested
- no cooling at night
- abwaerme nutzen


## Solar system and storage dimensioning

## Autarkic MRI 9/12
