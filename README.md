# MR carbon zero
A resource for MRI institutes / radiologic institutes towards realization of carbon neutral MRI.

## Current general energy demand of MRI
The energy demand of “a single MRI machine in clinical use […] corresponds to 25.8 four-person households” [[1]](#literature-references) The “daily energy consumption for a clinical MRIs  scanner in operation for 13 hours was estimated to be 363 kWh with 1.5 T units and 530 kWh with 3.0 T units”[[1]](#literature-references). 

Thus, yearly (300 days) thus sums up to 108 MWh for 1.5 T units  and 159 MWh for 3 T units.

With almost 3000 MRI machines in use alone in Germany, corresponding to the demand of approximately 75k households, this forms a substantial contribution to the national electric energy demand and to the national carbon footprint. In addition, in case of external energy shortage MRI diagnostics cannot be performed or only using emergency generators that again rely on external fuel resources.

Average per examination 20 kWh ± 5 (range, 12–34 kWh)

### Helium demand and zero boil-off
MR scanners have a rather high helium demand for the cooling system as upon usage, heating of the system leads to boil-off of helium.
On old systems this helium is either gathered for external reliquefying purposes or released to the environment.
Newer generation of MRI scanners have a so-called zero boil-off technology where the generated helium gas is locally collected and reliquefied. The additional helium demand is therefore marginal, which is a significant cost reduction, but the energy demand of zero boil-off systems is larger.

In both cases the helium reliquification process has to be included in the energy demand calculation.

The above mentioned energy demand is most probobably from system with zero boil-off techonolgy (Skyra, Verio, Avanto Fit, Espree), but this could not be verified, as avanto system without zero boil-off exist. It is assumed that this is included for the estimations herein.

### Dynamic energy demand 
The dynamic energy demand[[1]](#literature-references)  is given by teh following figures:

 - ![Dynamic Energy demand](../main/img/dynNRG-MRI_fig2.jpeg)

This shows that 
1. MRI has an high constant energy demand at both on and off time, due to the cooling
2. MRI has peaks of power demand up to 60 kWh for certain sequences (ssfp)
3. MRI has non-negligible idle energy demand during on times.

Which si also nicely summarized here:
